FreeBSD Scripts
==================

This repository contains several shell scripts that I have used to make
my life more convenient on my FreeBSD machine. They are presented here mostly for educational purposes. They are licensed under [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/fusion809/freebsd-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE). All the files in this repository with the file extension `.sh` are stored in my `~/Shell` directory. While `.bashrc` is stored in my user directory, `~/`.
